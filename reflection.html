                Responsive design refers to a user interface design to adjust accordingly to different screen sizes. Nowadays there are various devices that people use to surf the internet. Responsive design relates to web technologies because web sites or apps must satisfy the user interface for every device people use. It is not just different devices that responsive design is used for, but also for different window sizes on the same device. This means that when the user makes the window size smaller or bigger, the web page should resize accordingly. With effective responsive design, it provides user friendly interface, which eventually increases user experience.

                Before I started CPA program at Seneca, I went through bootcamp which focused on developing and designing websites. During that time, I learned about responsive design, and this is how to implement it. The most useful practice was CSS media queries. It can be written in the CSS file with the syntax @media screen and (min-width: 400px) {} or @media screen and (max-width: 400px) {}. Setting the screen with minimum value sets the CSS rules for any screen size bigger than or equal to value given. For maximum, it would be the opposite. For instance, when I am to develop a web page, I usually start with mobile first. I set the min-width in between 300 â€“ 500px since they are common size for mobile devices. I have a reason why I develop mobile first through my personal experience and research. Most of the time, mobile designs only need blocks to be stacked vertically, which means there is no need for display: grid, or display: flex. After completing mobile version, it is easier to use grid or flex for bigger sizes than to go from grid/flex to block levels. Moreover, combination of media queries can give more dynamics to the responsive design. There is a feature called orientation: landscape/portrait where when the device is tilted horizontally, the CSS rules apply accordingly. However, this only works for iPads. To achieve the same result, I can combine min-width and max-width. For example, @media screen and (min-width: 400px) and (max-width: 800px){}. This allows media queries to be applied only for screen sizes in between the given values. Generally, I like to set up 3 media queries one for mobile, tablet, and desktop. If I want to dive in deeper, I add a few more in between each setting. Also, another useful trick is to use max-width for width sizes. Using width gives a fixed size, but max-width allows the block to stretch as the window gets bigger. By using responsive design techniques effectively, web pages can be suitable for all devices.

                Before this course, I already had experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However, I did not feel confident in JavaScript as I did for HTML and CSS. This course helped me strengthen my skills and understand JavaScript deeper. I was only used to making static web pages, but after going through WEB 222, I finally understand how I can implement JavaScript to make dynamic web pages. I enjoyed every class and assignments, and I am very excited to learn more about it in the next semester.
